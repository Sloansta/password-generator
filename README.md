# password-generator
## Generates a password based off user input via 3 options 
- option 1: Length of password
- Option 2: Whether or not the user wants to add uppercase letters to their password
- Option 3: Whether or not the user wants to add symbols to their password

If both options 2 and 3 are not wanted, the user will have generated for them a password that is completely lowercase.
